For this project, I replicated the Google Homepage using HTML and CSS. I'm fairly proud my results.

This being my first project, in the end, I felt very comfortable with the HTML syntax, particularly HTML5. I think that HTML5 does a great job improving functionality through upgrading it's symantic tags. I became very confident in my use of divs, ids, href and many other attributes. I made a lot of progress along the way and became more comfortable with the language and it's structure.

Completing this project felt so great because I felt entirely better about CSS. At first I felt overwhelmed by the amount of CSS properties and I wasn't so sure how they worked in relation to each other. However, it all began to click and I made sure to go through each property over and over again so I knew exactly what purpose they had in my style sheet. Although I have a long way to go, I feel much more confident in my understanding of CSS. I also included FlexBox, which is honestly a life-saver in a lot of situations!

I look forward to keep learning as a developer.
